# Surfs_up

#Summary

#The analysis within the class serves to show us how to gather data from other sql programs, and converting it into easier to read functions. For the Analysis itself, it lets us
compare statistics, and determine which month would be the best to visit for surfing. 

#Results

#Overall, there are several key differences between the two:

#the weather in December is more volatile than June, as its standard deviation is roughly 3.75 versus 3.25, as seen in June_Stats.png versus Dec_Stats.png.

#from those same PNGs, the december weather varies more, as its range is (83-56) for 27 whereas June is (85-64) for 21. It's warmer on average based on the mean, but the weather 
could be just as warm in the summer. while the average is less in December, both appear to be within the same general space. 

#It appears as if december may be less accurate, as there are over 100 fewer observations.

#Summary

#Overall, June appears to be the superior choice, as the range is smaller and average temperature is higher. December days could be just as nice, but aren't as likely to happen.
Weather isn't merely temperatures, however, and other things worth considering are the rainfalls and windspeeds. Should things be too windy or rainy, it may make surfing 
unenjoyable, no matter the temperature. if it's possible to quantify how cloudy things can be, that would also be incredibly beneficial. If there's extra time, we could also look
at sky descriptions.
